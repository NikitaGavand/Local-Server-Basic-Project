The purpose of SPEED is to advance engineering education (EE) by providing a platform for global communication on EE practices between students as well as between students and other stakeholders, building a support network for students, and empowering students to take action locally and globally in improving their own educational environments.  By facilitating student action in this manner, SPEED provides a necessary perspective to EE policymakers to promote an EE system that is productive, inclusive, and forward-thinking.
